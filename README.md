# Introduction

Hello and thank you for joining us at the JavaScript Essentials Workshop!

My name is Lee Mulvey, a local freelance web developer, and I'll be your instructor today!

I've been programming for a lot of years now, but, I originally got my start managing the vBulletin forums for web comic Cyanide & Happiness. 

Special thanks to David Van Dusen with Lighthouse Labs for designing this course. He created the content--I've simpy forked it and changed a few things around. The original can be found at http://www.github.com/lighthouse-labs/gitbook-node-chat-tutorial 

Thanks to Bridge Coworking for allowing us to use their awesome space tonight for the workshop.

## Pair programming

You're encouraged to buddy up with one other person. That said, both of you should ideally do the setup work individually on your own laptops.

## The goal

Today's goal is to get acquainted with JavaScript-based Web programming by creating a simple chat application. We'll use modern tools \(Node.js, Web Sockets, etc.\) and touch upon many different technologies.

The objective is not to fully understand every line of code, but to understand server-client architecture and to be inspired by how much can be created with so little code.

## The product

The finished app that we'll be building in just a few hours today will look and feel much like this.
